 Experiments in tables

 ## Introduction

 This is prototyping accessing hierarchical data and using other backends to process it (like `servicex`, etc.).

 As a side note - this things is severly restricted by lack of a type system or type info. We need to be able to tell the difference between something that is a single item (like jet.pt()) and something that is a sequence (jet.tracks()).
